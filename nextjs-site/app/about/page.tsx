          When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring the paranormal, writing about technology, 
          or sharing slice-of-life stories on my blog. I believe in bringing creativity and 
          technical expertise together to build something meaningful.

        <p className="text-lg text-slate-700 leading-relaxed">
          I specialize in React, modern JavaScript, and crafting user experiences that feel 
          both intuitive and delightful. Let's build something amazing together.
