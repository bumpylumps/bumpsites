          Welcome! I'm a freelance developer with a passion for creating unique digital experiences. 
          My work spans across web development, creative projects, and everything in between.

          When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring the paranormal, writing about technology, 
          or sharing slice-of-life stories on my blog. I believe in bringing creativity and 
          technical expertise together to build something meaningful.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg text-mgs-dark leading-relaxed">
          I specialize in React, modern JavaScript, and crafting user experiences that feel 
          both intuitive and delightful. Let's build something amazing together.
