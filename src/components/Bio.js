            Hello, my name is
            <h1>Alex Fulop ðŸ‘‹</h1>

            I am a Full Stack Javascript Developer based in Connecticut, skilled at crafting websites and applications using React, Next, JavaScript, TypeScript, Express and MongoDB, 
            though I am very capable of learning new skills fast and happy to work in any environment.

            My greatest strengths are in Front End. I have excellent commercial experience in this area, with a keen interest to expand my skillset in a diverse range of technologies.


            <strong>I am open to new opportunities in the Tri-state area or remote.</strong>
