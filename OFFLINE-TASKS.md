## 🚫 AVOID THESE (Need Internet)

## 💡 TIPS FOR OFFLINE WORK

1. **Start with content** - easiest and most valuable
2. **Test frequently** - run `npm run dev` to see changes
3. **Commit often** - use git locally even without pushing
4. **Take breaks** - flights are long, pace yourself
5. **Screenshot progress** - document your before/after
